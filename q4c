The code implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching a graph. Let's break down how the BFS algorithm works in the context of this code:

### Code Breakdown

1. **Global Variables:**
   - `a[20][20]`: An adjacency matrix representing the graph. `a[i][j]` is non-zero if there is an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
   - `q[20]`: Queue used to manage the BFS traversal.
   - `visited[20]`: Array to keep track of visited vertices.
   - `n`: Number of vertices in the graph.
   - `i`, `j`: Loop counters.
   - `f`: Front of the queue.
   - `r`: Rear of the queue.

2. **BFS Function:**
   ```c
   void bfs(int v) {
       for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)
           if(a[v][i] && !visited[i])
               q[++r] = i;
       if(f <= r) {
           visited[q[f]] = 1;
           bfs(q[f++]);
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Initialization:** The function `bfs(int v)` performs a BFS starting from vertex `v`.
   - **Queue Management:** It checks all vertices adjacent to `v` (i.e., vertices `i` where `a[v][i]` is non-zero) and if these vertices have not been visited, they are added to the queue `q`.
   - **Recursive BFS Call:** After enqueueing all adjacent vertices, the function marks the vertex at the front of the queue as visited and then recursively performs BFS from that vertex. This recursion 
continues until all reachable nodes from the starting vertex are visited.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```c
   void main() {
       int v;
       printf("\n Enter the number of vertices:");
       scanf("%d", &n);
       
       for(i=1; i <= n; i++) {
           q[i] = 0;
           visited[i] = 0;
       }
       
       printf("\n Enter graph data in matrix form:\n");
       for(i=1; i<=n; i++) {
           for(j=1;j<=n;j++) {
               scanf("%d", &a[i][j]);
           }
       }
       
       printf("\n Enter the starting vertex:");
       scanf("%d", &v);
       bfs(v);
       printf("\n The nodes which are reachable are:\n");
       
       for(i=1; i <= n; i++) {
           if(visited[i])
               printf("%d\t", i);
           else {
               printf("\n BFS is not possible. Not all nodes are reachable");
               break;
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Input Handling:** Reads the number of vertices and the adjacency matrix.
   - **Queue and Visited Array Initialization:** Initializes the queue and visited array.
   - **Graph Data Input:** Takes input for the adjacency matrix.
   - **Starting Vertex:** Reads the starting vertex and performs BFS from that vertex.
   - **Output:** After BFS traversal, it prints all reachable nodes. If any nodes are not reachable, it outputs a message indicating that BFS is not possible for all nodes.

### Summary

- **BFS Algorithm:** Starts from a source node, explores all its neighbors, then moves to the next level of nodes, and continues this process level by level. The code uses a recursive approach for BFS 
where the function calls itself with the next node to be processed.
  
- **Queue Usage:** A queue is used to keep track of nodes to be visited. Nodes are enqueued when they are found to be adjacent and not visited yet. They are dequeued for processing (visiting) in the order 
they were added.

- **Visited Array:** This ensures that each node is processed only once to prevent infinite loops and redundant processing.

The provided code effectively demonstrates BFS traversal using recursion, although it has some limitations and assumptions like using 1-based indexing and a fixed-size queue. Adjustments might be needed for 
different graph representations or sizes.
